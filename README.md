<p>The focus of this project is to utilize statistical analysis to uncover relationships between various types of variables.</p><br>

<h2>Introduction<a name="introduction_h"></a></h2>
<p>In this project, I analyzed historical NBA data to investigate potential relationships between various variables. To identify these relationships, I employed statistical techniques such as Pearson correlation and Chi-squared testing. Additionally, I utilized plots such as box plots and frequency plots to visualize and better understand the relationships between variables. The goal of this project was to gain insights into the factors that may influence the outcome of NBA games.</p><br>
